# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to passenger survival. The analysis uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Objective
- Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset.
- Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Explore the distribution of key variables like Age, Fare, Gender, and Passenger Class.
- Analyze relationships between features and survival status.
- Gain insights that could help in building predictive models.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Titanic passenger data, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Key Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Overview (.info(), .describe())
2. Missing Value Analysis and Handling
3. Univariate Analysis (Histograms, Countplots)
4. Bivariate Analysis (Survival counts by category)
5. Multivariate Analysis (Pairplot, Correlation Heatmap)
6. Observations and Insights Documentation

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`05_Titanic_EDA.ipynb`).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Findings Summary
- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival compared to 2nd and 3rd class.
- Younger passengers, especially children, were more likely to survive.
- Fare and passenger class are correlated with survival.
- Embarkation point also showed some variation in survival rates.
